# Project Overview

This project is my COMP 400 Honours Research Project at McGill University, supervised by Professor Clark Verbrugge.

The goal is to explore path planning in stealth games, focusing on how an AI agent can stay hidden from a guardâ€™s line of sight while navigating a map. Using visibility polygons, shadow regions, and Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), the system evaluates possible player movements and computes the safest path that minimizes detection risk.
